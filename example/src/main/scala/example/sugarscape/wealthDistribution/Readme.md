This example is based on the wealth distribution example in Growing an artificial society. Each person starts with roughly equal wealth distribution. Over time, people walk around and collect sugar. Each person moves towards where the most sugar lies. At the end of each day, everyone consumes a different amount of sugar, defined by their metabolism rate. People also have lifespan. A person dies when her energy runs out or when she reaches her life expectancy. When a person passes away, she leaves behind an offspring. We assume there is no inheritance of wealth, and each offspring has a random amount of initial sugar.
